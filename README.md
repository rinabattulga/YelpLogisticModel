# YelpLogisticModel
Aggregated and prepped open-source Yelp data into two subgroups, permanently closed and open restaurants, represented in dataset as binary variables for retrospective case study
The predicting variables were restaurantâ€™s price range, Yelp star ratings, and review count. 

## Results
From the predicting variables, review count had the strongest association with the outcome of a restaurant staying open or not.

The final logistic regression: $y = 1.3529 - 0.189 price_range - 0.670 stars + 0.608 lnreview$
